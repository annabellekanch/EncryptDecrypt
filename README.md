# Base64 Encryption & Decryption

This is a simple encryption and decryption application using base64 to encode and tkinter as a gui. I wanted to learn a bit more about tkinter and on how to use it to create windows forms type applications but in python. I also wanted to learn more about AES Encrption tools, my next step with this project is to replace the base64 method to encode & decode and use pycryptodome. I am also working on incorporating a salt for the key to have a more secure encryption.
